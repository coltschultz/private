## üóÑ Database Schema Design

### Firestore Collections (Firebase Structure)

Since you're using Firebase, here's how to structure your data in Firestore:

```javascript
// Users Collection
users: {
  [userId]: {
    email: "user@example.com",
    fullName: "John Doe",
    phone: "+1234567890",
    avatarUrl: "https://...",
    userType: "cook" | "eater" | "both",
    isVerified: false,
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
  }
}

// Cook Profiles Collection
cookProfiles: {
  [userId]: {
    businessName: "Mom's Kitchen",
    description: "Authentic Italian cuisine...",
    specialties: ["italian", "vegetarian"],
    minAdvanceHours: 24,
    maxOrdersPerDay: 10,
    deliveryRadiusKm: 5.0,
    baseDeliveryFee: 3.50,
    isActive: true
  }
}

// Menu Items Collection
menuItems: {
  [menuItemId]: {
    cookId: "userId",
    title: "Homemade Lasagna",
    description: "Traditional recipe...",
    basePrice: 15.99,
    currency: "USD",
    category: "main-course",
    dietaryTags: ["vegetarian"],
    images: ["https://..."],
    ingredients: ["pasta", "cheese", "tomatoes"],
    allergens: ["dairy", "gluten"],
    minQuantity: 1,
    maxQuantity: 10,
    prepTimeHours: 2,
    isActive: true,
    createdAt: timestamp
  }
}

// Pricing Tiers Subcollection
menuItems/{menuItemId}/pricingTiers: {
  [tierId]: {
    minQuantity: 5,
    pricePerUnit: 14.99,
    isActive: true
  }
}

// Orders Collection
orders: {
  [orderId]: {
    buyerId: "userId",
    cookId: "userId",
    menuItemId: "menuItemId",
    quantity: 2,
    unitPrice: 15.99,
    totalAmount: 31.98,
    deliveryFee: 3.50,
    serviceFee: 2.50,
    status: "pending", // pending, accepted, preparing, ready, completed, cancelled
    requestedDate: "2024-01-15",
    requestedTime: "18:00",
    pickupAddress: "123 Main St",
    deliveryAddress: "456 Oak Ave",
    specialInstructions: "No onions please",
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
  }
}

// Reviews Collection
reviews: {
  [reviewId]: {
    orderId: "orderId",
    reviewerId: "userId",
    cookId: "userId",
    rating: 5,
    comment: "Amazing food!",
    createdAt: timestamp
  }
}

// User Locations Subcollection
users/{userId}/locations: {
  [locationId]: {
    label: "home",
    address: "123 Main St, City, State",
    latitude: 40.7128,
    longitude: -74.0060,
    isDefault: true
  }
}
```

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow (Firebase Auth)
1. **Email/Password** signup with Firebase Auth
2. **Google Sign-In** for easier onboarding (built into Expo)
3. **Phone verification** for cook accounts using Firebase Auth
4. **Profile completion** with role selection stored in Firestore

### Authorization with Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Cook profiles - only the cook can modify
    match /cookProfiles/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Menu items - cooks can CRUD their own, everyone can read active ones
    match /menuItems/{menuItemId} {
      allow read: if resource.data.isActive == true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.cookId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.cookId;
    }

    // Orders - buyers and cooks can see their own orders
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.buyerId || request.auth.uid == resource.data.cookId);
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
- **Firebase Auth** handles email verification automatically
- **Firestore Security Rules** protect user data
- **Cook verification** process using Firebase Storage for ID uploads
- **Stripe Connect** for secure payment processing

## üí≥ Payment & Order Management

### Payment Flow
1. **Stripe Connect** for marketplace payments
2. **Escrow system** - hold funds until order completion
3. **Automatic payouts** to cooks after successful delivery
4. **Platform fee** (5-10%) deducted from cook earnings

### Order Lifecycle
```
Pending ‚Üí Accepted ‚Üí Preparing ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí Completed
    ‚Üì
Cancelled (with refund policy)
```

### Key Features
- **Advance payment** required for all orders
- **Cancellation policy** (24h+ notice for full refund)
- **Dispute resolution** system with admin intervention
